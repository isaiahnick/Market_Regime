# Market Regime Detection with PCA and Gaussian Mixture Models

This project implements a data-driven approach to detecting financial market regimes by combining **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction with a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** for unsupervised clustering.  

The goal is to identify persistent market conditions (regimes) using historical financial and macroeconomic factors, inspired by approaches such as Two Sigma's factor lens research.

## Background
Financial markets often exhibit **regimes**‚Äîextended periods of relatively stable behavior (e.g., crisis, steady growth, inflationary periods).  
Detecting these regimes can help in:
- Risk management and stress testing
- Portfolio construction and tactical allocation
- Identifying market fragility

This project uses:
- **PCA** to reduce correlated factor data into orthogonal components.
- **GMM** to cluster observations into regimes, each modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

## Mathematical Overview

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- PCA is a linear transformation that projects high-dimensional data into orthogonal components ranked by variance explained.  
- Mathematically:  
  - Given a dataset **X** with covariance matrix **Œ£**, solve the eigenvalue problem:  
    
    **Œ£v<sub>i</sub> = Œª<sub>i</sub>v<sub>i</sub>**
    
  - Principal components are eigenvectors **v<sub>i</sub>** ordered by descending eigenvalues **Œª<sub>i</sub>**.  
- In this project, PCA reduces groups of factors (e.g., Equity, Credit, Commodities) into representative components.

### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- GMM assumes data is generated from a mixture of **K** Gaussian distributions:

  **p(x) = Œ£<sub>k=1</sub><sup>K</sup> œÄ<sub>k</sub> ùí©(x | Œº<sub>k</sub>, Œ£<sub>k</sub>)**
  
  where **œÄ<sub>k</sub>** are mixture weights, **Œº<sub>k</sub>** are means, and **Œ£<sub>k</sub>** are covariance matrices.  
- Parameters are estimated via the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm.
- Unlike K-means, GMM allows:
  - Soft cluster assignments (probabilistic regimes)
  - Elliptical clusters via covariance structure

## Setup and Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-regime-detection.git
cd market-regime-detection
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### FRED API Key
1. Go to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) and create a free account.
2. Generate an API key under **My Account > API Keys**.
3. Export it in your shell (or add to `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export FRED_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
4. The scripts will automatically use this key when downloading factor data.

## Usage

### Step 1: Compute Returns
```bash
python compute_returns.py
```

### Step 2: Run PCA + GMM
```bash
python pca.py
python gmm.py
```

- The script will:
  - Apply PCA to factor groups
  - Fit GMM across candidate numbers of clusters
  - Output regime probabilities and diagnostic metrics (AIC, BIC, Silhouette)
