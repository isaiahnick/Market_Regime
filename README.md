# Market Regime Detection with PCA and Gaussian Mixture Models

This project implements a data-driven approach to detecting financial market regimes by combining **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction with a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** for unsupervised clustering.  

The goal is to identify persistent market conditions (regimes) using historical financial and macroeconomic factors, inspired by approaches such as Two Sigma's factor lens research.

## Background
Financial markets often exhibit **regimes**‚Äîextended periods of relatively stable behavior (e.g., crisis, steady growth, inflationary periods).  
Detecting these regimes can help in:
- Risk management and stress testing
- Portfolio construction and tactical allocation
- Identifying market fragility

This project uses:
- **PCA** to reduce correlated factor data into orthogonal components.
- **GMM** to cluster observations into regimes, each modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

## Mathematical Overview

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- PCA is a linear transformation that projects high-dimensional data into orthogonal components ranked by variance explained.  
- Mathematically:  
  - Given a dataset **X** with covariance matrix **Œ£**, solve the eigenvalue problem:  
    
    **Œ£v<sub>i</sub> = Œª<sub>i</sub>v<sub>i</sub>**
    
  - Principal components are eigenvectors **v<sub>i</sub>** ordered by descending eigenvalues **Œª<sub>i</sub>**.  
- In this project, PCA reduces groups of factors (e.g., Equity, Credit, Commodities) into representative components.

### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- GMM assumes data is generated from a mixture of **K** Gaussian distributions:

  **p(x) = Œ£<sub>k=1</sub><sup>K</sup> œÄ<sub>k</sub> ùí©(x | Œº<sub>k</sub>, Œ£<sub>k</sub>)**
  
  where **œÄ<sub>k</sub>** are mixture weights, **Œº<sub>k</sub>** are means, and **Œ£<sub>k</sub>** are covariance matrices.  
- Parameters are estimated via the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm.
- Unlike K-means, GMM allows:
  - Soft cluster assignments (probabilistic regimes)
  - Elliptical clusters via covariance structure

## Setup and Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-regime-detection.git
cd market-regime-detection
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### FRED API Key Setup
1. Go to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) and create a free account.
2. Generate an API key under **My Account > API Keys**.
3. Export it in your shell (or add to `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export FRED_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

## Usage

Follow these steps in order to set up and run the analysis:

### Step 1: Prepare Raw Data
- Place your raw financial data files in the `data/` folder
- Ensure data is in CSV format with appropriate date and value columns

### Step 2: Initialize Database
```bash
python init_db.py
```
This creates the SQLite database structure for storing factor data.

### Step 3: Seed Instrument Metadata
```bash
python seed_instruments.py
```
This populates the database with instrument definitions and metadata.

### Step 4: Load Factor Data
Load data from various sources into the database:
```bash
python load_bloomberg.py    # Load Bloomberg market data
python load_fred.py         # Load FRED economic indicators  
python load_french.py       # Load French factor library data
```

### Step 5: Compute Returns
```bash
python compute_returns.py
```
This calculates returns and transformations for all factors in the database.

### Step 6: Principal Component Analysis
```bash
python pca.py
```
This applies PCA to factor groups to reduce dimensionality.

### Step 7: Gaussian Mixture Model Analysis
```bash
python gmm.py
```
This fits GMM across different numbers of clusters and outputs:
- Regime probabilities and assignments
- Model selection metrics (AIC, BIC, Silhouette)

### Step 8: Generate Visualizations
```bash
python visualizations.py
```
This provides various visualizations of our regime analysis (saved to /gmm_plots), such as:
- Regime evolution over time
- Mean returns and volatility per factor over each regime
- Model selection metrics
